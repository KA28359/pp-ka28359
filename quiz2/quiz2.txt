When it comes to C++, those programs are compiled into machine code and then the computer runs that code, similar to how a computer would run a C program. For Java, the process is more complex. When it comes to java, we have byte code that is created and we also have a Java vm that runs the byte code at runtime. Along with that the java compiler can also use JIT to optimize the code before sending it to the VM to be executed. This is the main reason that C and C++ programs run much faster than java programs for the most part.
